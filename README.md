# Hand Drawing Pad with Gesture Recognition

This mini project is a virtual drawing pad built with Python, OpenCV, and [cvzone's HandTrackingModule](https://github.com/cvzone/cvzone). It allows users to draw, erase, and interact with the canvas using hand gestures detected from a webcam.

## Features

- **Hand gesture recognition** for drawing, erasing, and selecting tools
- Draw lines and circles using finger movements
- Save your drawings as images
- Undo and clear the canvas
- Real-time feedback and overlays

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
- NumPy
- [cvzone](https://github.com/cvzone/cvzone)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or copy the script files.
2. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python numpy cvzone
    ```
3. Make sure your webcam is connected.

## Usage

Run the script:

```bash
python hand_draw_draing_pad.py
```

Follow the on-screen instructions and use your hand gestures to draw or erase on the virtual pad.
